# Administrative Burden in SNAP

**Definition:** The cumulative hassle, time cost, psychological burden, and learning costs that citizens experience when interacting with government programs.

---

## Theory

### Origins
Academic concept developed by public administration researchers to explain why eligible people don't use benefits they qualify for.

**Key Insight:** The problem isn't just awareness or stigma—it's the *cost of compliance* with program requirements.

### Three Types of Burden

1. **Learning Costs**
   - Understanding eligibility rules
   - Knowing what documents are needed
   - Figuring out where to apply
   - Learning how to recertify

2. **Compliance Costs**  
   - Gathering documentation (pay stubs, utility bills, rent receipts, etc.)
   - Attending in-person interviews
   - Traveling to offices during business hours
   - Taking time off work
   - Arranging childcare

3. **Psychological Costs**
   - Stigma of applying for "welfare"
   - Fear of being judged or mistreated
   - Anxiety about making mistakes that could lead to sanctions
   - Stress of navigating complex systems
   - Sense of powerlessness in bureaucratic interactions

## Evidence from SNAP

### Participation Gaps Correlate with Burden

**High-burden states (lower participation):**
- Require in-person interviews for all applicants
- Short recertification periods (6 months)
- Extensive documentation requirements
- Limited office hours (9-5 weekdays only)
- No online application options
- Strict verification processes

**Low-burden states (higher participation):**
- Telephone or online interviews accepted
- Longer recertification periods (12 months+)
- Simplified documentation (self-attestation for some items)
- Extended hours, weekend appointments
- Full online application systems
- Presumptive eligibility for some populations

**Example:** Illinois, Oregon, Wisconsin (100% participation) vs. Alaska (62%)

### Recertification as Choke Point

Research shows that **recertification is the biggest barrier to sustained participation**. People who successfully enroll often fail to re-enroll not because they're no longer eligible, but because:
- They miss appointment notifications
- They can't take time off work for interviews
- They're missing one document among many required
- The process is confusing and changes between certifications

**Quote from research:** "Difficulties in the recertification process due to the timing of scheduling of recertification interviews are known to decrease SNAP participation."

## Solutions

### Policy-Based Burden Reduction

1. **Simplify Eligibility**
   - Broad-based categorical eligibility (if you're on TANF, you're eligible for SNAP)
   - Fewer income deductions to calculate
   - Higher asset limits (so fewer people need to prove they don't have assets)

2. **Streamline Verification**
   - Accept copies of documents (not originals)
   - Allow electronic submissions (photos via phone)
   - Use data matching (verify income via state employment records, not pay stubs)
   - Self-attestation for hard-to-verify items

3. **Extend Timelines**
   - Longer certification periods (12+ months)
   - More flexible appointment scheduling
   - Grace periods for missed deadlines

4. **Improve Access**
   - Online applications
   - Telephone interviews
   - Same-day service for urgent cases
   - Multi-language support

### Technology-Based Burden Reduction

1. **Mobile Apps** (like Propel)
   - Check status without calling
   - Get reminders about recertification
   - Upload documents via phone camera
   - Track case progress in real-time

2. **Auto-Enrollment**
   - Use tax data to automatically enroll eligible people
   - Pre-fill applications using existing government records
   - Opt-out rather than opt-in

3. **AI Assistants**
   - Chatbots to answer common questions
   - Document checklist generators
   - Appointment scheduling bots

## Key Research Findings

### Biden White House Report (2022)
"Simplifying, permitting more flexibility in, or eliminating unnecessary reporting, documentation, and other requirements for application and recertification has been shown to increase program participation."

### ERS USDA Study
"Over time, States tended to adopt more policies that made participation easier or less costly in terms of stigma or administrative burden."

**Implication:** States *know* burden reduces participation. High-performing states act on this; low-performing states don't (or can't, due to political constraints).

## Critiques and Trade-Offs

### The Access vs. Integrity Dilemma

**Pro-Access Argument:**
- Administrative burden keeps eligible people out
- Fraud is actually quite low (~1% of benefits post-EBT)
- The cost of not reaching eligible people (hunger, health impacts) exceeds fraud costs
- Most "errors" are paperwork mistakes, not intentional fraud

**Pro-Integrity Argument:**
- Verification prevents ineligible people from getting benefits
- Strict rules protect taxpayer dollars
- "Too easy" enrollment could encourage fraud
- Recertification ensures continued eligibility

**Reality:** Most academic research shows that **burden reduction increases participation more than it increases fraud**. States like Illinois have both high participation AND low error rates, suggesting the dilemma is false—good systems can achieve both.

## Personal Reflections (Cal's Take)

Administrative burden isn't accidental. It's often *designed*—sometimes intentionally (to discourage "undeserving" applicants) and sometimes inadvertently (through risk-averse bureaucracy).

The key insight: **burden is distributed unequally**. 

Middle-class people applying for unemployment or student loans face barriers too, but they have:
- Reliable internet + computers
- Flexible work schedules
- Cars for transportation
- Literacy/language skills
- Social capital (know how to navigate bureaucracy)

SNAP applicants often lack these advantages. So every additional form, appointment, or verification step filters out *exactly the people most in need*.

High-performing states recognize this and design systems that meet people where they are. Low-performing states either don't recognize it or don't prioritize fixing it.

Technology (like Propel) can help, but only if it's designed *with* beneficiaries, not just *for* them. The goal isn't to automate burden—it's to eliminate it.
