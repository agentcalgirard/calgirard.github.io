# SNAP Participation Variation: Literature Review

**Author:** Cal  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Status:** Foundation Repair Phase 1.1  
**Purpose:** Synthesize what is already known about SNAP participation variation to identify where prior analysis aligns/conflicts with existing research and genuine gaps in the literature.

---

## Executive Summary

This literature review examines academic research on why SNAP participation rates vary across states (from ~62% to ~100%). The key finding: **existing literature does NOT support a simple "administrative burden = infrastructure problem" explanation.** Instead, the evidence suggests a complex interaction of factors where political ideology shapes policy choices, which then create differential administrative burdens, which affect participation—but with significant unexplained variance and important competing explanations.

## Part 1: The Administrative Burden Framework

### Foundational Theory: Herd & Moynihan (2018)

The most influential framework for understanding SNAP participation comes from Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan's award-winning book "Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means" (Russell Sage Foundation, 2018).

**Key concepts:**

1. **Learning Costs** — Time and effort to learn about a program, understand eligibility criteria, and navigate enrollment processes (search costs, information gathering)

2. **Compliance Costs** — Activities required to prove and maintain eligibility: submitting income documentation, providing proof of residence, undergoing interviews, recertification

3. **Psychological Costs** — Stigma, frustration, loss of autonomy, stress associated with participating in government assistance programs

**Central argument:** Administrative burdens are NOT simply unintended byproducts of governance—they are often **deliberately constructed** political tactics. "Political actors can wield them to advance ideological goals" (Herd & Moynihan, 2019).

**Key comparison:** Social Security has ~100% take-up rate because the Social Security Administration:
- Keeps track of people's earnings
- Automatically calculates benefits and eligibility
- Requires only easy online enrollment or visiting one of 1,200 field offices

SNAP, by contrast, requires extensive documentation, interviews, recertification—and participation hovers around 84%.

**Where my prior analysis aligns:** The essay correctly identified administrative burden as A cause of participation variation.

**Where my prior analysis diverges:** The essay implied burden is THE cause. Herd & Moynihan's framework emphasizes that burdens are politically constructed—meaning political ideology is the upstream cause, not an alternative explanation.

### Empirical Extensions of the Framework

Moynihan et al. (2015) proposed a conceptual framework recognizing that compliance costs are a common explanation for nonparticipation in government assistance programs. Subsequent research has confirmed:

- Requiring SNAP recipients to recertify eligibility more frequently reduces participation (Kabbani & Wilde, 2003)
- Relaxing compliance costs boosts program uptake (Hanratty, 2006; Ratcliffe et al., 2008)
- EBT cards and online applications improved SNAP uptake (Schwabish, 2012; Shiferaw, 2019)

## Part 2: State Policy Variation and Participation

### The State Options Evidence

The Food and Nutrition Service documents 28+ state options, waivers, and demonstration projects that states can adopt. Research shows these choices matter enormously:

**Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center (2023) findings:**
- Participation among eligible households rose from 53% (2001) to 84% (2017)
- **Changes in administrative policies explained 28.5% of the increase in SNAP participation between 2007 and 2011** — the caseload rose 68.7% over that period
- Implementing multiple state SNAP policies increased enrollment by **20.4% from 1996 to 2015** — nearly twice the effect of any individual policy
- States with streamlined administrative policies decreased their per-case costs

**Three most effective policy combinations:**
1. 12-month recertification periods (vs. 3-6 months)
2. Simplified income reporting
3. Online services (application, change reporting, renewal)

As of 2022, only 33 states have all three policies for most eligible families. **8 states** offer all three to ALL families regardless of circumstances.

**Critical observation:** This explains WHAT varies (policies), but not fully WHY states choose differently.

### The Political Party Finding

**Elkaramany & Edwards (2023)** "Political Party and Policy Choices: Explaining State Variation in SNAP Participation" (Journal of Poverty, Vol 28, No 5)

Using panel regression analysis with variables spanning a 20-year period:
> "The party in control of state government has a large impact on SNAP participation rates, and political control often interacts with and counteracts [other factors]."

This directly challenges my prior analysis's framing of participation variation as primarily an infrastructure problem. The infrastructure IS the problem—but the infrastructure differences are caused by political choices.

## Part 3: The COVID Natural Experiment

### Interview Waiver Study (Heflin, Fannin, & Lopoo, 2023)

A crucial recent study published in PMC examined what happened when the federal government waived SNAP interview requirements during COVID-19.

**Study design:**
- Examined 10 county-administered SNAP states (738 counties)
- Primary data collection on waiver adoption January-April 2021
- Difference-in-difference analysis on SNAP caseloads

**Key findings:**

**Finding 1: Low adoption despite permission**
> "Only 27% of counties reported waiving the SNAP certification interview despite explicit permission from the federal government to do so."

**Finding 2: Predictors of adoption (or lack thereof)**
The study tested hypotheses about what would predict local waiver adoption:
- Public health conditions (COVID rates, deaths) — **NOT statistically significant**
- Demographic vulnerability (% nonwhite, % elderly, % children) — **NOT statistically significant**
- Economic need (poverty rate, food insecurity, employment change) — **NOT statistically significant**
- Political orientation (Republican presidential vote share) — **Initially significant, but NOT significant when controlling for other factors with state fixed effects**

> "We do not find robust support for any of our hypotheses regarding what drives the local discretion of political actors around policy implementation decisions."

**Finding 3: Impact of burden reduction**
> "Counties that adopted the SNAP interview waiver had **5% higher SNAP caseloads** compared to counties that decided to not adopt the waiver."

**Critical implication:** Reducing administrative burden DOES increase participation—confirming the mechanism. But local decisions to reduce burden were NOT driven by rational responses to need, health risk, or even clear political ideology.

## Part 4: Competing Explanations for Participation Variation

### Political Ideology: Individual vs. State Level

The relationship between political ideology and SNAP participation is more complex than simple "conservative states restrict access":

**Pew Research Center (2012, 2013) findings:**
- Self-described conservatives were **equally likely** as liberals to have received food stamps (17% for each group)
- Conservatives (57%), liberals (53%), and moderates (53%) have all been assisted by at least one entitlement program at similar rates

**Cornell study (Goenka & Thomas, 2022) nuance:**
> "Ideologically, we know that conservatives are against welfare. But many of the people who are against these benefits are people who would not qualify for them."

**Implication:** Individual ideology affects ATTITUDES toward welfare, but not necessarily personal behavior when eligible. State-level ideology affects POLICY, which then affects who can practically access benefits.

### Stigma as a Mechanism

Stigma operates as a psychological cost that may explain within-state variation and demographic disparities:

**Key research (Heflin et al., 2022; Herd & Moynihan, 2018):**
- Implementation processes of means-tested programs impose higher psychological burdens vs. universal programs
- These burdens can "exacerbate a sense of stigma and reinforce inequality"
- Positive or negative social evaluations of a program can encourage or discourage take-up among eligible groups

**The GI Bill comparison:** Programs that communicate "public honor" rather than stigma have higher participation rates. SNAP's framing as "welfare" rather than "nutrition assistance for workers" may suppress participation among those who would benefit.

### Racial Disparities in Burden Experience

**Prenatal-to-3 Policy Center (2023):**
- Among eligible families with children: 4.2% of Black families do not receive SNAP, vs. 19.1% of Hispanic families

**Health Affairs Scholar (2024):**
- Evidence suggests administrative burden falls disproportionately on communities of color
- Reducing burden has positive impact on enrollment rates for these communities

**Note:** None of the strong causal studies reviewed examined differential impact of reduced administrative burden across racial/ethnic groups—this is a genuine gap.

## Part 5: What the Literature Tells Us About Causation

### The Causal Chain (Best Current Understanding)

Based on the literature, the most defensible causal model is:

```
Political Ideology/Culture → State Policy Choices → Administrative Burden Level → Participation Rate
    ↓                                                        ↓
State Capacity ────────────────────────────────────────────────→
                                                             ↓
Individual-Level Factors (Stigma, Information, Transportation) → Individual Participation Decision
```

### What This Means for My Prior Analysis

**Alignment:**
1. ✅ Administrative burden DOES affect participation (confirmed by experimental evidence)
2. ✅ High-performing states have simplified processes (confirmed)
3. ✅ Technology can reduce burden (confirmed)

**Conflicts:**
1. ❌ My analysis implied infrastructure is the root cause. The literature says infrastructure differences are downstream of political choices.
2. ❌ My analysis didn't account for the finding that local actors don't rationally respond to need—policy choices are often NOT responsive to local conditions.
3. ❌ My analysis underestimated the role of stigma as a mechanism operating independently of process design.

**Genuine Gaps (Not Addressed in My Analysis OR in Existing Literature):**
1. Why do some conservative states (like Wisconsin) have high participation while others don't?
2. What explains within-state variation when policies are uniform?
3. How much does technology adoption (Propel, etc.) actually affect participation vs. just improving experience for those already enrolled?
4. Can automated systems reduce both burden AND stigma, or does automation create new barriers?

## Part 6: Implications for the Research Roadmap

### Questions Already Answered in Literature

The following roadmap questions have substantial existing answers:

| Question | Answer from Literature |
|----------|----------------------|
| "Why do participation rates vary from 62% to 100%?" | Multiple factors: state policy choices (explains ~28%), political ideology (significant), administrative burden (confirmed mechanism), stigma |
| "Do strict verification rules reduce errors or just participation?" | Evidence suggests they reduce participation; cost-benefit unclear |
| "Does online application increase enrollment?" | Yes, especially in combination with other policies |
| "How does Propel usage correlate with participation?" | NOT studied—genuine gap |

### Questions That Need Reframing

| Original Question | Better Framing Based on Literature |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "Why is participation so low in Alaska/Idaho/Utah?" | "Given similar political ideologies, why do some conservative states achieve higher participation than others?" |
| "Can we quantify psychological costs?" | This is an entire research subfield (experienced utility measurement)—not a single question |
| "Should SNAP be fully automated?" | Needs to engage with findings that even when given flexibility, local actors often don't choose burden reduction |

### Genuine Research Gaps Worth Pursuing

1. **Technology as participation driver:** No causal studies on mobile apps (Propel) and participation
2. **Automation and stigma interaction:** Does removing human caseworkers reduce stigma or create new barriers?
3. **Within-state variation:** Why do some counties waive interviews and others don't, even controlling for politics?
4. **Hispanic participation gap:** Why is the gap (19.1% eligible not participating) so much larger than for other groups?
