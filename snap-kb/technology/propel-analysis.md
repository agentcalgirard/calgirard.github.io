---

## Business Model

**Revenue Sources:**
1. **Selective Advertising** - Partners offer services tailored to EBT users:
   - Free phones (Lifeline program)
   - Discounted internet
   - Grocery savings at major retailers
   - **NOT predatory lending** - deliberately avoids payday loans, high-interest credit

2. **Profitability:** Achieved in 2024 (GAAP basis)

**Key Insight:** Propel monetizes by connecting EBT users with services they actually need, not by exploiting them. This builds trust and sustains growth.

## Strategic Position

### Strengths
1. **User Base:** 5M+ users = ~12% of all SNAP recipients
2. **Trust:** Voluntary adoption, no fees, privacy-respecting
3. **Technical Capability:** Integrates with 50 state EBT systems
4. **Profitability:** Business model works without exploiting users

### Opportunities
1. **Government Interface Layer:** Could handle recertification, applications, cross-program coordination
2. **State Partnerships:** Offer analytics dashboard showing real-time program health
3. **Cross-Program Expansion:** WIC, TANF, Medicaid integration
4. **Financial Services:** Savings, credit building tailored to beneficiaries

### Threats
1. **Government Competition:** States could build their own apps (but unlikely given procurement challenges)
2. **Regulation:** Privacy laws, data-sharing restrictions could limit expansion
3. **Mission Creep:** Expanding too fast could dilute core product quality
4. **Trust Erosion:** Any misstep (data breach, predatory partnerships) destroys years of goodwill

## Case Study: $10 Million Emergency Fund (Oct 2025)

**Context:** Government shutdown threatened to delay SNAP deposits  
**Response:** Propel launched emergency fund with $1M initial + $9M fundraising goal  
**Distribution:** $50 cash transfers to families receiving maximum SNAP allotment (indicator of extremely low income)  
**Timeline:** Announced Oct 29, distributions began Nov 1 (day of missed deposits)  
**Partner:** GiveDirectly (established cash transfer organization)

**Significance:**
- Proof of concept: Propel can distribute emergency assistance faster than government
- Trust signal: Users trust Propel to identify who needs help and deliver it fairly
- Infrastructure test: If they can do this, why not recertification? Applications?

## Key Questions

1. **Will states partner with Propel?** Requires overcoming procurement barriers, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in
2. **Can Propel maintain trust while expanding?** Mission creep vs focused excellence trade-off
3. **What's the regulatory path?** FDA has no "TurboTax for SNAP" equivalent yet
4. **How does profitability scale?** Current model works at 5M users—what about 20M? 40M?

## Comparisons

### vs. Government Apps
- **Propel:** 5M+ users, 5-star ratings, fast iteration
- **Government:** Low adoption (<10-15%), clunky UX, slow procurement

### vs. Other Fintechs
- **Propel:** Serves underbanked, no predatory products, mission-driven
- **Payday lenders:** Exploit vulnerability, high fees, unsustainable
- **Chime/Cash App:** Serve working/middle class, not safety net beneficiaries

### vs. Benefits Navigators
- **Propel:** Post-enrollment (balance checking)
- **Frontdoor:** Pre-enrollment (application assistance)
- **Forage:** Merchant-side (online EBT payments)

**Opportunity:** Propel could integrate all three layers - application + usage + merchant
