# Alternative Explanations for SNAP Participation Variation

**Author:** Cal  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Status:** Foundation Repair Phase 1.3  
**Purpose:** Document alternative explanations for participation variation with evidence for and against each, revising the thesis to acknowledge uncertainty.

## The Original Claim

My essay asserted:
> "The participation gap is an infrastructure problem, not a funding or eligibility problem."

And further:
> "When Illinois, Oregon, and Wisconsin achieve 100% SNAP participation rates while Alaska sits at 62%, the explanation isn't poverty levels or food insecurity."

**The problem:** This framing presents a **false dichotomy** and **assumes causation from correlation**. Let me examine five alternative explanations with evidence.

---

## Alternative Hypothesis 1: Political Ideology/Culture

### The Claim
State participation rates differ primarily because of political ideology—conservative states create more restrictive policies that reduce access, regardless of actual need or administrative efficiency.

### Evidence FOR

**Journal of Poverty (2023) finding:**
> "The party in control of state government has a large impact on SNAP participation rates."

**Correlation patterns:**
- Low-participation states (Alaska 62%, Idaho 64%, Utah 65%) tend to be politically conservative
- High-participation states (IL, OR, WI, MA) tend to be moderate or liberal
- Utah has the lowest % of population on SNAP (4.8%) AND low participation rate

**Policy choices follow ideology:**
- States that require fingerprinting, drug testing, strict work requirements tend conservative
- States with simplified reporting, longer certification periods tend progressive

**COVID waiver evidence (Heflin et al., 2023):**
- Republican presidential vote share was initially correlated with lower waiver adoption (p < .05)
- Counties with higher Republican vote share were less likely to adopt the interview waiver

### Evidence AGAINST

**The Wisconsin paradox:**
- Wisconsin is a politically competitive state that voted for Trump in 2016
- Yet Wisconsin has 100% SNAP participation
- If ideology were determinative, Wisconsin should have lower rates

**Individual ideology doesn't predict receipt (Pew 2012):**
- Conservatives (57%), liberals (53%), and moderates (53%) have all benefited from safety net programs at similar rates
- Self-described conservatives were equally likely as liberals to have received food stamps (17% each)

**Full model finding (Heflin et al., 2023):**
- When controlling for other factors with state fixed effects, Republican vote share was **NOT statistically significant**
- "We do not find robust support for any of our hypotheses regarding what drives the local discretion of political actors"

### Assessment

**Strength of explanation:** MODERATE

Political ideology explains POLICY CHOICES, but policy choices don't fully explain participation. There's something else happening. Ideology may be necessary but not sufficient.

## Alternative Hypothesis 2: Demographics (Rural vs. Urban)

### The Claim
Low-participation states have more rural populations, and rural residents face unique barriers (distance to offices, lack of internet, transportation) that reduce participation regardless of state policy.

### Evidence FOR

**Geographic barriers are real:**
- Alaska (62% participation) has extreme geographic isolation
- Wyoming (68% participation) is the least populous state with vast distances
- Rural applicants face transportation costs urban applicants don't

**Technology adoption gap:**
- Online applications help participation, but rural areas may have less internet access
- Older populations (common in rural areas) may be less tech-comfortable

**Different labor markets:**
- Rural economies often include self-employment, seasonal work, informal labor
- These are harder to document for SNAP eligibility, increasing compliance burden

### Evidence AGAINST

**High-participation rural states exist:**
- New Mexico is 23% rural and has 97% participation rate
- Oregon has significant rural population but 100% participation
- Vermont (93% participation) is rural

**Low-participation urban areas exist:**
- California has only 91% participation despite being highly urban
- Texas (88%) has massive urban centers (Houston, Dallas, Austin)

**PMC study found demographics not significant:**
- Percent rural was NOT a statistically significant predictor of waiver adoption
- Percent nonwhite, percent elderly, population size—all NOT significant

### Assessment

**Strength of explanation:** WEAK

Rural/urban differences may create barriers, but they don't explain most of the variance. Vermont and New Mexico prove rural states CAN achieve high participation. This hypothesis might explain some edge cases (Alaska) but not the general pattern.

## Alternative Hypothesis 3: State Government Capacity

### The Claim
Some states simply have better administrative capacity—better IT systems, more trained caseworkers, better organizational culture—independent of policy choices.

### Evidence FOR

**Legacy systems vary enormously:**
- State SNAP systems range from 1970s mainframes to modern cloud platforms
- Some states can process applications in days; others take weeks
- County-administered states (10 states) have fragmented capacity

**Administrative cost variation:**
- USDA reports significant variation in per-case administrative costs
- States with streamlined policies decreased per-case costs (PN3, 2019)

**Caseworker capacity matters:**
- Caseload per worker varies dramatically
- High-burden states may simply have overwhelmed staff

**Organizational culture:**
- Some agencies view their mission as "gatekeeping"
- Others view it as "connecting eligible people to benefits"
- This affects how policies are implemented regardless of what policies say

### Evidence AGAINST

**Federal funding equalizes some capacity:**
- USDA reimburses 100% of benefit costs
- USDA reimburses 50% of administrative costs
- State capacity differences are partly a choice about investment priorities

**Capacity vs. will:**
- The COVID study showed most counties DIDN'T adopt waivers even when given explicit permission
- This suggests capacity isn't the binding constraint—choice is

**Cross-state learning is possible:**
- California's GetCalFresh model spread to other states
- Wisconsin achieved 100% participation—their methods could be copied
- If capacity were the constraint, low-performing states would be studying high performers

### Assessment

**Strength of explanation:** MODERATE

Capacity constraints are real, but they're often downstream of investment choices and organizational priorities. "Low capacity" may be a symptom rather than a cause.

## Alternative Hypothesis 4: Historical Path Dependence

### The Claim
Current participation rates reflect accumulated historical decisions, organizational inertia, and established relationships—states are "locked in" to patterns that are hard to change.

### Evidence FOR

**Food stamps have long history:**
- Program began 1964, with different states adopting at different times
- Early adopters may have built stronger infrastructure
- States that resisted welfare programs in 1960s-70s may still lag

**Policy stickiness:**
- Once a state establishes 6-month recertification, changing to 12-month requires overcoming bureaucratic inertia
- IT systems designed for one process are hard to retrofit
- Staff trained in one approach resist changes

**Political economy of reform:**
- Caseworker unions may resist automation that reduces jobs
- Vendors with existing contracts lobby against changes
- Advocacy groups may have entrenched relationships with current systems

### Evidence AGAINST

**Rapid changes have occurred:**
- SNAP participation nationally rose from 53% (2001) to 84% (2017)—dramatic change in 16 years
- COVID waivers showed states CAN change quickly when motivated
- Maryland and Kentucky increased recertification intervals in the last year

**New entrants achieve high performance:**
- GetCalFresh (now Frontdoor Benefits) helped millions access SNAP in California
- Propel grew from 0 to 5M+ users in ~10 years
- Path dependence shouldn't affect new organizations

**Political transitions override history:**
- When state legislatures flip, SNAP policies often change within 1-2 years
- Path dependence suggests slow change; political reality shows rapid policy shifts

### Assessment

**Strength of explanation:** WEAK-MODERATE

Path dependence explains why change is slow, but not why some states overcame inertia while others didn't. It may explain the persistence of gaps but not their origin.

## Alternative Hypothesis 5: Stigma and Self-Selection

### The Claim
Some states have cultures where accepting government assistance is more stigmatized. Eligible people voluntarily decline to apply because of shame, not because of administrative barriers.

### Evidence FOR

**Stigma is documented mechanism:**
- Herd & Moynihan's framework includes "psychological costs"
- Studies show stigma affects take-up of means-tested programs
- Programs framed positively (GI Bill) have higher take-up than those framed negatively (welfare)

**Regional cultural differences:**
- "Rugged individualism" culture may be stronger in Mountain West states (low participation)
- States with stronger communal values may have less stigma

**Self-reported barriers:**
- Surveys of eligible non-participants cite embarrassment, not wanting handouts
- Some people don't apply even when they know they're eligible and process is easy

**Individual conservatives don't take up less (Pew):**
- But this might mean conservatives in conservative states DO take up less
- Self-selection could operate at community level rather than individual ideology

### Evidence AGAINST

**Stigma is hard to separate from burden:**
- Are people not applying because of shame, or because the process feels shameful?
- Simplified processes may reduce stigma by reducing the "proving you're poor" aspect
- EBT cards (that look like debit cards) reduced stigma—design matters

**High participation in diverse cultural contexts:**
- New Mexico (diverse, Hispanic-majority) has 97% participation
- Washington DC (urban, diverse) has 99% participation
- Illinois (mix of Chicago and rural) has 100%
- These suggest culture isn't determinative

**Stigma can be changed:**
- SNAP rebranding from "food stamps" was partly about reducing stigma
- Propel positions itself as "financial tool" not "welfare app"
- If stigma were fixed cultural trait, these efforts wouldn't matter

### Assessment

**Strength of explanation:** MODERATE

Stigma is real but likely interacts with program design. States that make SNAP feel less stigmatizing (easier process, less intrusive verification, dignified framing) likely have higher participation partly because they've reduced psychological costs—not because their populations inherently have less stigma.

## Synthesis: Revised Thesis

Based on this analysis, my original claim should be revised from:

> **Original:** "The participation gap is an infrastructure problem, not a funding or eligibility problem."

To:

> **Revised:** "The participation gap results from the interaction of political ideology (which shapes policy choices), state administrative capacity (which constrains implementation), and program design (which affects both administrative burden and stigma). Infrastructure matters, but infrastructure differences are primarily downstream of political choices, not independent of them. The question 'why do participation rates vary?' cannot be answered without addressing 'why do states make different political choices about SNAP?'"

### Key uncertainties to acknowledge:

1. **The Wisconsin puzzle:** Why do some politically competitive states achieve 100% participation while others don't? The explanation likely involves state-specific factors (leadership, historical advocacy, bureaucratic culture) that are hard to generalize.

2. **The Hispanic participation gap:** 19.1% of eligible Hispanic families don't receive SNAP—much higher than other groups. This is not fully explained by any hypothesis above and may involve immigration fears, language barriers, or different stigma dynamics.

3. **Causality direction:** Do simplified policies cause higher participation, or do states with populations that want to participate adopt simplified policies? The evidence suggests both directions operate.

4. **Automation's role:** We don't know whether Propel-style technology increases participation or just improves experience for existing participants. This is a genuine research gap.

## Implications for the Essay and Roadmap

### Essay should be revised to:
1. Acknowledge political economy as upstream cause
2. Present administrative burden as mechanism rather than root cause
3. Note that "high-performing states simplified process" may be reverse causation
4. Include uncertainty about what drives state policy choices

### Roadmap should add:
1. Questions about political determinants of SNAP policy
2. Research on why some conservative states achieve high participation
3. Investigation of Hispanic participation gap specifically
4. Causal studies on technology and participation (not just experience)

## Summary Table

| Hypothesis | Evidence Strength | Likely Contribution |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Political Ideology | Moderate | Shapes policy choices but doesn't fully explain variation |
| Rural/Urban | Weak | Explains some edge cases (Alaska) but not general pattern |
| State Capacity | Moderate | Real constraint but often reflects investment priorities |
| Path Dependence | Weak-Moderate | Explains persistence of gaps but not their origin |
| Stigma/Self-Selection | Moderate | Interacts with program design; not fixed cultural trait |

**None of these hypotheses alone explains participation variation.** The best explanation involves interaction effects, state-specific factors, and likely some factors we haven't identified.
